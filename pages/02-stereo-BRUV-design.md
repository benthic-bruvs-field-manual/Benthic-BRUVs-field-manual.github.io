Stereo-BRUV systems consist of two convergent video cameras inside waterproof housings, attached to a base-bar (Fig. 1b), held in a frame (Fig. 1a), with some form of baited container in front of the cameras (Fig. 1e). Systems are generally tethered by rope to surface buoys (Fig. 1c). Ballast can be added to frames for use in deep-water or areas of strong current (Fig.1f).

## Cameras and Photogrammetry

We recommend cameras with full, high-definition resolution of at least 1920 x 1080 pixels (Harvey_ et al._ 2010) and a capture rate of at least 30 frames per second (note some models of action cameras can overheat at high resolution e.g. 4K). Higher camera resolution will improve identification of fish, and the pixel selection required for measurement. Higher frame rates reduce blur on fast-moving species. To maintain stereo-calibrations, cameras must have video stabilisation disabled, and a fixed focal length can facilitate measurements both close to and far from the camera systems when correctly calibrated (Shortis, Harvey & Abdo 2009; Boutros, Shortis & Harvey 2015). The field of view should be standardised and chosen to limit distortion in the image (e.g. no more than a medium angle, ~95° H-FOV). When sampling demersal fish assemblages at typical maximum range (8 m) from the cameras, Boutros _et al._ (2015) suggested a separation &lt; 500 mm will result in a decrease in the accuracy of measurements, with measurement precision being a function of 1/(camera separation). Cameras are fixed to a rigid base bar to preserve the stereo-calibration required to calculate accurate length and range measurements (Harvey & Shortis 1995, 1998; Shortis & Harvey 1998; Shortis _et al_. 2009; Boutros _et al._ 2015). The system pictured in Fig. 1 uses GoPro Hero 5 Black cameras, with camera housings separated by 700 mm with 7° convergence angle on a steel base bar, although 500 mm with a 5° convergence angle is also common.

Stereo-calibrations must be made both prior to and following a field campaign.  Given the required tolerances involved with stereo-BRUV construction, we recommend seeking manufacture and calibration advice from recognised providers or adhering to strict specifications. Any changes in camera positioning (e.g. if a camera is dismounted during battery replacement) will disrupt the stereo-calibration, resulting in measurement error. For this reason, most “off-the-shelf” housings remain unsuitable for stereo-BRUVs. Figure 1h provides an example of a camera that is secured to the housing faceplate to ensure stability. Each housing and camera should be uniquely identified, ensuring the latter are only used on the system they are calibrated for. A flashing LED may be added to the end of the diode arm to aid synchronisation of imagery from the left and right cameras when submerged (Figure 1).


## Bait

As a general rule, locally sourced, sardine-type oily bait is recommended (Dorman _et al._ 2012), as the oil disperses to attract fish. Sourcing sardine bait locally from factory discards (e.g. fish heads, tails and guts) will reduce the survey’s ecological footprint, cost of sampling and potential for disease translocation. We recommend 0.8–1 kg of roughly crushed bait, positioned between 1.2 m and 1.5 m in front of the cameras with the mesh bait bag as close to the benthos as possible. Positioning outside of this range will reduce the ability to identify and measure individuals. 


## Deployment Time

Benthic stereo-BRUVs should be deployed for a standard duration. We recommend deployments of 60 min, to allow species detection (Currey-Randall _et al._ 2020), and facilitate comparison with historical data. Deployments of 30 minutes have been demonstrated to be sufficient for sampling particular species of finfish on shallow temperate reefs (Bernard & Götz 2012; Harasti _et al._ 2015). 

**Sampling Design**

Sampling strategies should be designed to ensure valid inferences and interpretations of resulting data (Smith, Anderson & Pawley 2017). We recommend spatially balanced statistical routines, such as R package MBHdesign (Foster _et al._ 2019), which can incorporate environmental information and legacy sites to create sampling designs with known inclusion probabilities (Foster _et al._ 2017, 2018). Due to the need to revisit each site to retrieve stereo-BRUVs after deployment, spatially balanced designs may be inefficient for sampling large regions (>10 minutes transit time between samples), and clustered sampling designs may be preferred (Hill _et al._ 2018).

Individual stereo-BRUV samples should be separated to reduce the likelihood of non-independence due to individuals being concurrently sampled by adjacent stereo-BRUVs. Separation distance will depend on the mobility of the species and the habitat being studied, for typical demersal fish assemblages a minimum of 400 m for one-hour deployments is recommended (Bond _et al._ 2018b) or 250 m for 30 minute deployments (Cappo, Speare & Wassenberg 2001).

## Field logistics

Vessels fitted with a swinging davit arm, or pot-tipper and winch are ideal for deploying and retrieving stereo-BRUVs in deeper waters (Fig 2), however, light-weight stereo-BRUVs (Supp. 2) can be retrieved by hand. Comparable trap fishing retrieval methods are generally the most efficient. Each retrieval design remains dependent on the type of vessel used, stereo-BRUV weight and size, and prevailing sea conditions. Local fishers familiar with a study location can provide valuable advice on sampling logistics. Multiple stereo-BRUVs can be deployed concurrently, with ~10 stereo-BRUV systems providing optimum logistical efficiency for 60 minute deployment times. Crepuscular periods should be avoided due to demonstrated changes in fish behaviour during these times (Myers _et al._ 2016; Bond _et al._ 2018a). When sampling in low light conditions, both blue (450-465 nm) and white (550–560 nm) lights can be used. White can provide the best imagery for identification (Birt _et al._ 2019), but blue has been found to avoid potential behavioural biases and reduce backscatter from plankton at night (Fitzpatrick, McLean & Harvey 2013). Field methodology checklists are provided in Supp. 3.
