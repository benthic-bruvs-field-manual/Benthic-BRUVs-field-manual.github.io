**Supp 2 Figure 1**:  Stereo-BRUV systems, including (A) standard dimensions, and (B) addition of weights for deeper water deployment and added forward and rear facing lights and rear facing stills camera to collect habitat imagery.

**Supp Figure 2**:  Light weight stereo-BRUV. (A) Frame made of thin gauge stainless steel. Diode arm is passed through the back and front of the frame and not attached to the base bar. This reduces strain to the base bar during retrieval and allows the base bar to be made of light-weight hollow aluminum rectangular section (D). Base bar uses hooks and bungee cords to attach to the frame. The separation of cameras has been reduced to 500mm, with camera convergence of 5 degrees, to decrease the size of systems and making them easier for (B) travel with and use on smaller vessels and can be (C) hand-hauled. For research projects led by partners without expertise in stereo calibrations, (E) frames can be manufactured locally and pre-calibrated light-weight base bars can be sent to study site. See this video example of [deploying light weight stereo-BRUV](https://youtu.be/xMrsWunUf3k)



**Supp Figure 3**:  Stereo-BRUV systems developed by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS). Designed to be easily assembled and packed down with detachable legs that occupy minimal space when shipping. The cameras are inwardly converged at 5 degrees and separated by 650mm. Camera cradles are precision machined and have a locating pin that aligns with the back of the camera housing which allows for housings to be easily removed from the frame (for battery change, downloading etc.) and put back in the exact same position, maintaining camera calibration. A plate across the top of the frame allows for additional backward facing cameras or lights to be attached. The lack of rails along the front and back of the frame footing reduces potential for seabed snags and minimises contact with seabed habitats.
