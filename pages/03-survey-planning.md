Although BRUVs are a non-destructive technique, permits may still be required for deployment in certain areas (e.g. marine protected areas, Indigenous Protected Areas). Prior to undertaking any marine survey, researchers are responsible for ensuring appropriate applications for permission are lodged, with subsequent relevant approvals obtained and documented. More information regarding legislation and permitting can be found on the AusSeabed website ([www.ausseabed.gov.au/resources/permit](http://www.ausseabed.gov.au/resources/permit)). 

Additionally, researchers should engage with local communities, including Traditional Owners, to understand their research priorities and share knowledge. See [Indigenous Partnerships and Engagement](https://introduction-field-manual.github.io/universal-protocols#indigenous-partnership-and-engagement) in Chapter 1 for further details.
