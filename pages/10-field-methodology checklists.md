## **Pre-field work**


1. Check equipment as shown in Figure 1.
2. Conduct 3D calibration of stereo-camera pairs. We recommend an enclosed pool environment with good visibility. This must be repeated at the end of the field campaign, or if any camera or housing positions have changed.
3. Ensure sampling design can be imported to the research vessel navigation system, or bring a standalone navigation and sounding system for the skipper.
4. Ensure sufficient data storage capacity for downloading all video imagery collected, and for back-up copies.
5. Ensure sufficient spares for stereo-BRUVs (Figure 1).
6. Purchase bait and ensure it can be stored appropriately for the duration of fieldwork. 
7. Create a metadata sheet or preferably using a capture device (e.g. Collector for ArcGIS or QGIS, tablet computer with GIS) to record the sample, stereo-camera pair and memory card unique identifier in addition to other essential field data (Supp. 4). By capturing metadata digitally transcription errors and post-field work time are reduced.


## **Pre-deployment **



1. Set up stereo-BRUVs, including ropes and floats.
2. Check camera batteries are charged and memory cards are formatted.
3. Check the batteries in lights and synchronising devices if applicable. 
4. Defrost enough bait the night before sampling.
5. Discuss deployment, retrieval procedures and safety with skipper and crew.


## **Deployment**

See this video example of [deploying light weight stereo-BRUV](https://youtu.be/xMrsWunUf3k)



1. Fill bait containers with ~1 kg of crushed bait.
2. Turn cameras on and ensure there is sufficient battery life and storage space.
3. Check camera settings are consistent.
4. Film the metadata sheet or capture device with each camera so information can be attributed to the video footage.
5. Check the camera housings are dry and clean before aligning and inserting cameras. Check o-rings are not pinched or dirty.
6. Attach the bait arm and turn on exterior lights (if applicable).
7. Ensure a means of synchronising cameras such as a flashing diode, a stopwatch, slow clapper board or hand clap is recorded within view of both cameras simultaneously.
8. Once on site, and at the command of the master, experienced personnel or deck hands should physically deploy stereo-BRUV, ropes, and floats clear of the vessel. Ropes and floats may need to be streamed in advance if operating in deepwater.
9. It is important the vessel remains directly over the site whilst deploying. In shallow water, it may be necessary to arrest the deployment of the stereo-BRUV above the bottom to ensure it maintains orientation. In water depths >30 m and when using ballast, rope drag through the water is often enough to maintain orientation and the system can be left to freefall from the surface.
10. When the stereo-BRUV lands on the seafloor a waypoint should be taken.
11. Ensure all field metadata and comments are collected (as in Supp 4).


## **Retrieval **



1. Once deployment (sampling) time is complete, vessels should manoeuvre alongside the surface floats heading upwind or upcurrent. 
2. Crew gaff or grapple the rope between the floats and retrieve slack rope as the vessel manoeuvres over the system. 
3. Stereo-BRUVs should only be retrieved once the vessel is directly above the deployment site. Stereo-BRUVs retrieved at an angle are prone to being dragged and caught on the benthos. 
4. Once the stereo-BRUV is on deck, dry the housings and remove cameras and their memory cards and change bait. Check battery life is sufficient for another deployment and turn the cameras off to preserve battery life. 
5. Ensure all field metadata and comments are collected (as in Supp 4).


## **End of day checks**

Review, download, and backup all footage during or at the end of each day. Save separate samples in a folder structure with clear naming conventions [(see Jordan S. Goetze et al. 2019)](https://paperpile.com/c/ZpRR79/M7q0/?prefix=see). Format memory cards for the next day once the videos have been checked, downloaded, and backed-up. Ensure all field metadata and comments are collected (as in Supp 4).
