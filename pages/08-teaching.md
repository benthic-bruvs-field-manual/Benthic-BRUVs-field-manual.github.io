Stereo-BRUVs (Baited Remote Underwater Video Systems) are an excellent method for teaching because they provide hands-on experience with a non-invasive technique to study fishes. By allowing students to analyse real footage of fish and their behaviors, they learn about fish diversity, habitat interactions, and ecological monitoring in a practical context. It's important for students to be exposed to diverse marine research methods like stereo-BRUVs to develop a well-rounded understanding of environmental assessment, promoting critical thinking and enhancing fieldwork skills.

Please see the video below as a real world example of undergraduate students at the University of Western Australia using stereo-BRUVs in a field research project.
